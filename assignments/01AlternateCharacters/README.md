# Alternate characters

Modify the file `src/exercise.py` so that the program performs as described below:

```python
def main():
  # Substitute this comment and the pass expression with your code
  pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Description

Write a function **alternate_characters** that takes as argument an integer value **n**.
The function does not return anything, but displays n characters alternating between `#` and `%`.

The characters must be displayed one on each line.

Note that the first character to be displayed is always `#`.

#### Inputs
A single integer number.

#### Outputs
The program prints **n** characters, one in each line.
The characters alternate between `#` and `%`.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE:
The output of your program must be exactly identical to the examples shown below:

When calling only the function:
```
alternate_characters(0)


alternate_characters(6)
#
%
#
%
#
%
```

When running the whole program:
```
Enter number of characters: 8
#
%
#
%
#
%
#
%


Enter number of characters: 1
#
```
